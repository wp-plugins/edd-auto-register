Automatically creates a WP user account at checkout, based on customer's email address.

== Description ==

This plugin now requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads") v1.9 or greater. 

[View the live demo](http://edd-auto-register.sumobithemes.com/downloads/test-download/ "Live Demo")

Once activated, EDD Auto Register will create a WordPress user account for your customer at checkout, without the need for the customer to enter any additional information. This eliminates the need for the default EDD registration form, and drastically reduces the time it takes your customers to complete their purchase.

There are various filters available for developers, see the FAQ tab for more information.

If EDD's "Disable Guest Checkout" is enabled, the plugin loads it's own error message that makes more sense to the plugin. Also, if Edd's "Show Register / Login Form?" is enabled, the plugin will load it's own simple version of the login form.
